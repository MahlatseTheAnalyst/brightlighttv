BrightTV Viewership Insights Project

This SQL-based data analysis project explores viewership behavior on BrightTV by integrating session-level data with user demographic profiles. The goal was to generate detailed insights into content consumption patterns, user segmentation, and engagement trends to support strategic content and marketing decisions.

Key Analysis Components:
Temporal Trends: Extracted viewing patterns by day of the week, time of day (TIME_BUCKET, TIME_GROUPING), and month.

Demographic Segmentation: Grouped users by age (AGE_GROUP), gender, race, and province.

Session Categorization: Classified sessions into buckets (SESSION_LENGTH_BUCKET) based on duration and assigned total sessions per user.

Behavioral Patterns: Identified users with social media presence (HAS_SOCIAL_MEDIA) and correlated viewing times with demographic attributes.

Technologies Used:

SQL (SNOWFLAKES)
MIRO(FLOW_CHART PLANNING)
EXCEL(VISUALISATIONS)
CANVA(PRESENTATION)

BrightTV database (viewership and user profiles)

Outcome:
This project provides a robust foundation for understanding BrightTV's user base, optimizing content scheduling, and tailoring engagement strategies for different audience segments.
